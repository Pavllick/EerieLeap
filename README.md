# EerieLeap üå°Ô∏è

EerieLeap is an open-source sensor monitoring system built with .NET Core. It provides a robust platform for reading, processing, and managing sensor data with support for both physical ADC sensors and virtual calculated sensors.

## Features

- üîå **ADC Integration**: Direct interface with ADC hardware for real-time sensor readings
- üîÑ **Virtual Sensors**: Create derived measurements using mathematical expressions
- üåê **RESTful API**: Full HTTP API for configuration and data access
- ‚ö° **Real-time Updates**: Continuous sensor monitoring with configurable sampling rates
- üìä **Flexible Configuration**: JSON-based configuration for ADC and sensor settings
- üßÆ **Expression Engine**: Advanced mathematical expressions for sensor value conversion and virtual sensor calculations

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- .NET 6.0 or later
- Compatible ADC hardware

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/eerie_leap.git
cd eerie_leap
```

2. Build the solution:
```bash
dotnet build
```

3. Run the application:
```bash
dotnet run --project EerieLeap
```

### Packaging

To build deb package, install [dotnet-packaging](https://github.com/quamotion/dotnet-packaging/tree/master) globaly:
```bash
dotnet tool install --global dotnet-deb
```

Then run, from project root:
```bash
dotnet deb ./EerieLeap/EerieLeap.csproj --runtime linux-x64 --output ../build/linux_x64
```

The resulting package can be found in the `build/linux_x64` directory.

### Development

The project uses Intermediate Language (IL) injection as a post-build step, defined in the `EerieLeap.csproj` file. This can make debugging challenging, as the final code is modified after compilation, preventing the debugger from accurately mapping the project code to the running code. IL injection is used only in the `ValidationProcessor` project to add custom validations based on attributes.

As a workaround for debugging, this compilation step can be temporarily removed by deleting the `InjectIL` target section from the `EerieLeap.csproj` file.

## Configuration

The system uses several configuration files:

### Application Settings
The `appsettings.json` file in the EerieLeap project contains application-level settings:
- `ConfigurationPath`: Path to the directory containing sensor and ADC configurations
- Standard ASP.NET Core settings (logging, etc.)

### Launch Settings
The `Properties/launchSettings.json` file configures the application's runtime environment:
- HTTP/HTTPS URLs and ports
- Environment variables
- Runtime profile settings

### Sensor and ADC Configuration
These files are stored in the directory specified by `ConfigurationPath`:

#### ADC Configuration
The `adc.json` file contains device-specific settings that control how the ADC hardware operates, including sampling rates, conversion modes, and power settings. The configuration structure depends on the specific ADC hardware being used.

#### ADC Processing Script Configuration
The `adc_config_script.js` file contains JavaScript code used by the ADC data processor to acquire and process data from sensors. The JavaScript script must implement the `function process(channel)` method, which is called every time a new value is requested by the system. It can optionally implement the `function init()` and `function dispose()` methods, which will be called once during ADC initialization and disposal, respectively.

Some helper objects are exposed to the script to enable ADC configuration. These objects are located in the `EerieLeap.Domain.AdcDomain.Hardware.Adapters` namespace within the EerieLeap project code. Currently, two helper classes are available in the script: `SpiAdapter` and `GpioAdapter` which can be used for SPI communication and Input/Output port management, respectively.

#### Sensor Configuration
The `sensors.json` file defines two types of sensors:

#### Physical Sensors
Physical sensors represent direct connections to ADC channels. Their configuration includes:
- Channel assignment
- Voltage ranges for input
- Value ranges for output
- Units and sampling rates
- Custom conversion expressions using NCalc (voltage value referenced as 'x')

Both physical and virtual sensors use the [NCalc](https://github.com/ncalc/ncalc) expression evaluation engine:
- For physical sensors: transforms raw voltage readings ('x') into final values
- For virtual sensors: combines readings from other sensors (referenced as {sensor_id})
- Supports arithmetic operations, mathematical functions (Sin, Cos, Log, etc.), and constants (PI, E)

For detailed expression syntax and capabilities, refer to the [NCalc documentation](https://github.com/ncalc/ncalc/wiki/Documentation).

#### Virtual Sensors
Virtual sensors perform calculations based on readings from other sensors.
